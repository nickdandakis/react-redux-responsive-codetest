# The React, Redux, Responsive design Code Test

## Setup

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Objective

Create a web application that creates, reads and deletes contacts to/from a Firebase database.
This repository is already set up as a Next.js application, with Redux connected via the `withRedux` 
higher-order component.

## Requirements

- Basic form validation (required fields)
- Create a contact
- Read contacts
- Delete contact
- Usage of Redux for contacts
- Usage of Firebase database
- Responsive layout changes

## Brownie points

- Complete the beloved **CRUD** acronym with **updating** a contact, ideally on its own page
- Display a loader when retrieving/sending data from/to Firebase
